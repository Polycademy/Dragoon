TESTS
=====

This will house the Codeception tests for the framework itself. But also you can make tests for your application here.


Since the framework itself will be light weight, we don't have to worry about test bloat. The framework is your source code!

Although we can group the tests! Or Namespace them using Dragoon

This place should probably house client side tests too. No need for tests to be publicly accessible.
